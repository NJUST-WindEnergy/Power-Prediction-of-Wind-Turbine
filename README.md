# Power-Prediction-of-Wind-Turbine
This project shares the codes in the paper: Power Prediction of Wind Turbine in the Wake using Hybrid Physical Process and Machine Learning Models, Renewable Energy.<br>
All the codes are developed originally from Wind Energy Research Group in Energy and Power Enginnering School of Nanjing University of Science and Technology.
## A list of python files:
  * TwoStageTrAdaBoostR2: it is a hybrid model of physical model and transfer learning algorithm. It needsto be called by mark40 (below) for WT power prediction. It should be in the same directory as the program below. <br>
  * mark40: The executable python programs of the six HPML models.<br>
 # Please refer to the paper above for the construction process of the models.
